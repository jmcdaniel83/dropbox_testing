# Dropbox API Testing

Wanted to get a feel for leveraging Dropbox as a backup location, but making the process much easier utilizing their APIs helps when moving items around if I'm running on a VM on AWS, GCP, or Azure to push and backup a game world to Dropbox.  Was able to get the API to work with the appropriate configuration.  Providing an example config .ini file for reference.

# Placeholders

Have some work in progress related to the database, deployment, and quests I was working on.
